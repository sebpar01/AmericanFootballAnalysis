# Bachelor Thesis - README
This is the Repository for my bachelor's thesis: Automatisierte Nachbereitung von Filmaufnahmen im American Football mittels Deep-Learning-Algorithmus (Automated post-processing of football footage in American Football using a Deep Learning approach)

# Introduction
This repository contains all the code and files which are necessary for my bachelor's thesis. The aim of the thesis is to classify American football plays based on videos. This repository includes a brief explanation of each file. More detailed information about the methodology has been documented in my bachelor's thesis. In the future, this repository will also include an overview of the methodology.

More to come soon...
Stay tuned.
