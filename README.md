# Bachelor Thesis - README
This is the Repository for my bachelor's thesis: Automatisierte Nachbereitung von Filmaufnahmen im American Football mittels Deep-Learning-Algorithmus (Automated post-processing of football footage in American Football using a Deep Learning approach)

# Introduction
This repository contains all the code and files which are necessary for my bachelor's thesis. The aim of the thesis is to classify American football plays based on videos. This repository includes a brief explanation of each file. More detailed information about the methodology has been documented in my bachelor's thesis. In the future, this repository will also include an overview of the methodology.

More to come soon...
Stay tuned.
# Labeling 

## Video Labeling (labeling_tool.py)
PyQt6 dashboard to assign labels to a running video. An existing dashboard was adapted for this purpose. Assigned labels are saved (timestamps in seconds) in a YAML file.

## Frame Labeling (frame_labeling.py)

Code to convert the previously conducted labeling of an entire video to individual frames. The existing YAML file is converted from seconds to frames by calculating the fps. Then, a separate folder is created for each label, in which the corresponding frames are stored.

# Dataset

## Statistics (statistics.py)
Code for generating statistics to capture the frequency and distribution of the classes.

# Development of the Neural Network

## Binary Classification (Binary_Classification.ipynb)

## Multiclass Classification (Play_Type_Classification.ipynb)

# Additional Code

## plot.py
 Code to creat plots to visualize results and processes; a plot for labeling is presented here.
